# My-Social-Media-WebSite

I created a user-friendly and responsive social media website using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. The project incorporates modern CSS properties like variables, grid, and flexbox. It includes functionalities such as sidebar menu toggle, chat search, modal open and close, font size customization, and primary color/background theme customization, all implemented using JavaScript.
